      <h2>Path Name:</h2>
      <p>All paths using this calculator need to have the form /operation/number/number .  Operator should be the operation that you wish to perform.  Currently this calculator supports the following operations:<ul>
        <li>Addition (Add)</li>
        <li>Subtraction (subtact)</li>
        <li>Multiplication (multiply)</li>
        <li>Division (divide)</li>
        <li>Exponentiation (pow)</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>The numbers that follow are the two numbers that you wish the operation to be performed on.  NOTE: the order does matter.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <h5>Example</h5>
        <p>/subtact/13/2 would run 13-2</p>
